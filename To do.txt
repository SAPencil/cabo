To do


1. Determine plan for data types needed for game
2. Write functions for each event which can happen during game
3. Write functions(?) which order what events can happen, and who can call those events
4. Decide on how to implement a UI (Most simple option being HTML elements, then use pyQuery, which I've only just found out about and might not be useful, to link html to python)
5. Link UI to python
6. Set up backend server to store the state of the game, and receive requests to alter the state(This is the bit I have very little idea about how it works, so would be a learning curve for me)
